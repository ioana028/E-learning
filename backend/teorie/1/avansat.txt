INTRODUCTION TO ENGLISH – ADVANCED LEVEL

At an advanced level, one must not merely *use* the English language, but *command* it — with elegance, nuance, and precision. The art of introductions and elementary expressions evolves into a refined mastery of tone, grammar, and lexical variety. This document offers not only modern formulations but also literary and formal phrases drawn from traditional and historical English usage.

1. FORMAL AND ELEVATED GREETINGS

In lieu of common greetings such as “Hi” or “Hello”, one may employ:
- Good day to you.
- How dost thou fare? (archaic) = Cum îți merge?

- Pray, allow me a moment of your time.

In academic or professional settings, one might say:
- It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- I hope this message finds you well.
- Kindly receive my salutations.

2. REFINED SELF-INTRODUCTION

Instead of “My name is John”, consider:
- Permit me to introduce myself formally: I am Jonathan Whitmore, a scholar of linguistics.
- My appellation is known as Elizabeth, daughter of Arthur, hailing from the county of Devon.

In literature or period speech:

6. SAMPLE ELEVATED PARAGRAPH

Allow me, if you will, to present a modest reflection:

“Though I hail from distant shores where English is seldom spoken, I have, through tireless exertion and unwavering curiosity, ventured into the labyrinth of this language. With every phrase I utter, I seek not mere correctness, but elegance. It is not enough to speak; one must speak well. And thus, I proceed — humbly, diligently — toward mastery.”
